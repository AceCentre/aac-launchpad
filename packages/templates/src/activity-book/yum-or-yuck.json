E.g a Yummy piece of cheese and a Yucky spider \n•Say to the switch user for example “shall we have some yum cheese on our sandwich or a yuck spider?!” \n•If the switch user hits the switch that says Yum, the nice ingredient is added to their snack \n•If the switch user hits the switch that says yuck, the nasty ingredient is added to their snack"
