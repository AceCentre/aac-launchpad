# Launchpad

Ace Centre has been offering free symbols based resources on our website for a number of years. We see a lot of people regularly downloading our resources which is why we try and add new ones when we can.

However, we wanted to be able to provide you with more options when downloading your symbol based resources. We wanted you to be able to chose your symbol set, the language you wanted

You can find these new customisable resources in the 'resources' section of our website with the 'customise' banner.

In the future we want to add more ways for you to customise the resources and we want to make more of our resources customisable. [Let us know what you think about our new resources by filling out this form.](https://forms.office.com/r/E4jRZ5eyJu)
